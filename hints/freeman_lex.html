        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        It’s simple! You need to find the length of a given string and check if it’s bigger than 6.

    <div class="question">
        Ok. It makes sense. How can I find the length then?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Try to use a built-in function <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len">len()</a>
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        OK. How can I compare it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <pre class="brush: python">
cond1 = len(password) > 6
        </pre>
        Will return True in case of the password being bigger than 6, else False.
    </div>

        That should be it. However, I still can't put everything together.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_acceptable_password(password: str) -> bool:
    
    cond1 = len(password) > 6

    return cond1
        </pre>
        That should be your solution.

        Thanks! I know and understand more now! Everything works fine!

    <div class="answer">
        Glad to hear it! Try to solve the next one in series.
